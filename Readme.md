I made this Django structured blog during my formation on python and Django with Docstring organism. 
</br>
This consists in a simple CRUD exercise, for which you can create, read, update and delete blog articles. 
</br>
The user space has not been implemented yet but the signup form is already coded.
</br>
</br>
To run this program :
</br>
1. Install project dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt
</br>
2. Source the project environment : <i>$ source venv/Scripts/activate</i>
</br>
3. Execute <i>$python manage.py runserver</i>
</br>
</br>
Urls :
</br>
- <i>/</i> (main index)
- <i>about/</i> 
- <i>customadmin/</i> (admin interface)
- <i>blog/</i> (blog index)
- <i>create-article/</i> (article creation form)
- <i>blog/< str:slug >/</i> (article view)
- <i>blog/< str:slug >/edit/</i> (article modification form)
- <i>blog/< str:slug >/delete/</i> (article deletion)
- <i>signup/</i> (to be implemented)
